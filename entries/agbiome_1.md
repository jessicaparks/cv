notes: [
  "I performed microbial isolation, stocking, and growth for pest assays;
  and I led an experiment that resulted in the addition of a selective isolation strategy
  that was used for about half of AgBiome's 80,000+ microbe collection.",
  "I identified candidate pesticidal proteins from microbial genomes,
  and developed a Python workflow to prepare the resulting data for patent filing. This protein
  collection resulted in multiple research partnership deals with other biotech companies.",
  "I led project planning, user testing, and coordination with a software partner for
  development of a Postgres database and Ruby-on-Rails app. This was a multi-year project
  with a budget up to $1M, and the product was used by the company for 7+ years."
